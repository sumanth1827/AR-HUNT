# AR-HUNT
An AR based treasure hunt around bits pilani goa campus. It involes 4 interactive posters that are in 4 hidden location and each poster has a hint that has to be found with the help of the ar camera to get to the next poster.
This is not it, there are mini games as well that were made from scratch specifically for this event that the player has to complete in order to be able to get acceess to the hint. This app was tested during Quark 2023 in bits goa on march 25th 2023.
Steps:
Player goes to first poster, scans poster with our app.
This leads them to the first mini game. The player has to complete it.
Once the player completes it, the camera launches again and the player can scan the poster again. This time a hint will be revealed.
The hint itself might be hidden within the poster. For example, in the first poster, on completing the game and scanning again, a key is hidden somewhere on the poster on the app and the player has to find it and put it in the key box in order to opent a door which reveals the hint.
This similar process is repeated for many other posters with different mini games and different cryptic clues along with it.

This repository includes the unity files as well as the apk file of the game itself.
